# beerandwinematcher-finalcoderacademyproject
final coder academy project. incomplete, but shows basic functionality of all sections.

# Project:

For my project I worked on my own, after being in a group that was dissolved.

I approached the company for which I work, BWS asking them what they thought might be a good service they would need in-stores this communication was carried out over Google+ on the BWS Area 02 and National "Communities" on Google+

Staff and Managers quickly responded via comment section saying that they'd like to see a wine, beer and food matching service in-stores which would be implemented on in-store iPads available to customers and staff.

I set about creating some early mockups and showed them to the managers and staff that responded.

The mockups can be found here: https://www.figma.com/file/BAic1HWbQ53SJreq1Kg3XHHj/BWS-Mockups

I then implemented the web service as they were happy with the way the mockup looked and I used Bootstrap Studio: https://bootstrapstudio.io to build the basic structure of the website in a visual representation, and manipulated the exported code using Atom: https://atom.io/ until I was able to get it looking the way I wanted.

# Notes:

I made this project to run on iPad screens, so it's best to view on that size screen, but it is responsive and should work on larger and smaller screens.

Some of the pages are incomplete as I only completed certain sections to show a "proof of concept" and not the complete functionality.

I plan to finish the site in the future...perhaps with the help of BWS/Woolworths Digital Team....
